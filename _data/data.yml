        company: Limoo Host, Mashhad
        details: |
            At Limoo Host, a leading web hosting company serving thousands of clients with a focus on WordPress hosting, I began as an intern and quickly advanced in my role. I started by gaining hands-on experience with essential web hosting concepts, including DNS management, SSL certificate configuration, and troubleshooting WordPress websites.
            During my time there, I developed a deep interest in Linux, which I mastered swiftly. This led to increased responsibilities, where I was granted access to the company’s servers and entrusted with configuring bare metal servers into fully operational web hosting platforms. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in managing Linux-based systems, configuring Apache web servers, and setting up and optimizing MySQL databases.
            By the end of my tenure, I played a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and scalability of the company’s web hosting infrastructure, contributing to the overall success of Limoo Host's operations.            - Bullet point
