            At Part Software Group, I began my role as a Monitoring Specialist, where I was responsible for configuring monitoring servers to track the performance of various systems and applications. I set up servers using Telegraf to gather metrics from other servers across the company. Additionally, I wrote numerous Bash and Python scripts to extract metrics in JSON format from both servers and applications, automating and optimizing the data collection process.
            I became proficient with time series databases (TSDBs) such as Prometheus and InfluxDB, using them to store and analyze large volumes of metrics and . Over time, I became the primary maintainer of the company’s monitoring infrastructure, ensuring its smooth operation and accuracy.

This led to increased responsibilities, where I was granted access to the company’s servers and entrusted with configuring bare metal servers into fully operational web hosting platforms. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in managing Linux-based systems, configuring Apache web servers, and setting up and optimizing MySQL databases.
